# Beecrowd Problem Solutions in C++

This repository contains my personal solutions to programming problems from the Beecrowd Online Judge, formerly known as URI Online Judge. All solutions are written in C++.

👨‍💻 About Me

My Beecrowd profile: [Nicolas Vondolinger](https://judge.beecrowd.com/pt/profile/717551)

I solve these problems as part of my continuous learning in algorithms, data structures, and competitive programming.

📂 Repository Structure

Each solution file is named according to the problem number and contains the full C++ implementation. Example:

├── 1001.cpp   # Extremely Basic
├── 1002.cpp   # Area of a Circle
├── ...

The code is usually self-contained, using standard input/output to comply with Beecrowd's submission requirements.

✅ Problem Categories

The problems span several categories, including but not limited to:

    Beginner

    Strings

    Mathematics

    Data Structures

    Graphs

    Dynamic Programming

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed. To compile and run a file:

    g++ 1001.cpp -o 1001
    ./1001

Input should be provided via standard input (e.g., by typing manually or piping from a file).

📌 Notes

    All solutions were accepted on Beecrowd unless otherwise noted.

    This repository is for educational purposes. Please use it responsibly and avoid copying solutions without understanding them.
